# Water Flow Monitoring System

This project logs water flow from a physical flowmeter connected to an Arduino and visualizes the data in a web based chart.

---

## üß† Overview

- The **Arduino** reads real-time data from a flowmeter sensor and sends it over Serial.
- A **Python script** reads the Serial output and writes flow values to a `values.txt` file.
- A **website** (in the same folder) reads `values.txt` and displays a live-updating chart.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware

- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- YF-S201 flowmeter (or similar)
- Flowmeter data wire connected to **digital pin 2**
- Pull-up resistor (if needed, 10kŒ© between signal and VCC)

### ‚ö° Wiring

| Flowmeter Pin | Arduino Pin |
|---------------|-------------|
| VCC           | 5V          |
| GND           | GND         |
| SIGNAL        | D2          |

## üîå To Run

Open the terminal and navigate to the WaterFlow directory:
```batch
cd WaterFlow
```
Then, install the dependecies and start the development server:
```batch
npm install
npm run dev
```
Go back to the main project directory and install the Python dependenyc:
```batch
cd ..
pip install pyserial
```
After uploading the `.ino` file to your Arduino, make sure the serial monitor is closed and run:
```batch
py writer.py
```

Your website should be up and running at https://localhost:5050/.
